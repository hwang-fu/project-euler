# Highly Divisible Triangular Number

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.
The first ten terms would be: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
__1__: 1
__3__: 1,3
__6__: 1,2,3,6
__10__: 1,2,5,10
__15__: 1,3,5,15
__21__: 1,3,7,21
__28__: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
