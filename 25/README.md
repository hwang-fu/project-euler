# 1000-digit Fibonacci Number

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
__F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)__, where __F(1) = 1__ and __F(2) = 1__.

Hence the first __12__ terms will be:
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(3) = 2
F(4) = 3
F(5) = 5
F(6) = 8
F(7) = 13
F(8) = 21
F(9) = 34
F(10) = 55
F(11) = 89
F(12) = 144

The 12th term, __F(12)__, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain __1000__ digits?
