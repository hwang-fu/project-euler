# Non-Abundant Sums

A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of __28__ would be __1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28__, which means that __28__ is a perfect number.

A number __n__ is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than __n__ and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds __n__.

As __12__ is the smallest abundant number, __1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16__, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is __24__. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than __28123__ can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
