# Number Spiral Diagonals

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

__21__ 22 23 24 __25__

20  __7__  8  __9__ 10

19  6  __1__  2 11

18  __5__  4  __3__ 12

__17__ 16 15 14 __13__

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
